# my-portfolio
Sure, here's a description you can use for your portfolio website:

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio website, built using ReactJS. This website showcases my personal information and the projects I have worked on in a clean and easy-to-read format. I put a lot of effort into making the code organized and efficient, so it's easy to maintain and update.

I also added some cool features to the website, like the ability to send me an email using the emailJS library. I used React-Bootstrap for styling to make the website look great and easy to use. Plus, I added some visually appealing icons using the React-Icons library.

But the best part is the carousel! I used the Swiper library to create a cool and engaging carousel that displays some of my projects.

Overall, I'm really proud of this website, and I hope you find it informative and visually appealing. Thanks for visiting!
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
